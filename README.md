# Summer 2022
## Algorithms in C++
I am going to implement some simple algorithms in C++ for my enjoyment and as a learning tool for C++

## First attempt - Selection Sort, naive
May 29, successful naive
Would like to try:
- Passing array as a pointer
- Test with larger arrays
- Create a timer and do some measurements
